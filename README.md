# Pirio

## Installation

You can use any code editor you like but if you do not know what to choose try out [Pycharm](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=install+pycharm) as the community edition is free and it rocks.

The following steps are for people developing on linux or WSL, you may need to adapt some commands if you want to use a different OS.

Install [python](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=install+python), and [pipenv](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=install+pipenv)

Clone the project:  
`git clone git@github.com:DimitriKouliche/Pirio.git`

Install dependencies:  
`pipenv install`

Go into the code directory:  
`cd code`

Create virtual environment:  
`pipenv shell`

Run the project:  
`python main.py`
